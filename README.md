# Biodiversity_Project
Analzying the types and amounts of bacteria cultures within the belly button. Goal is to better understand the biodiversity within the naval cavity. We published the results from a json file to a html webpage as a dashboard with the following elements: 1.) a bar chart showing the types and amounts of the top ten bacteria within the test subject's naval cavity; 2.) a bubble chart that visualizes the frequency of ALL bacteria cultures found within the test subject's naval cavity; and 3.) a gauge chart showing the amount of times in a week the test subject washes their naval cavity. The third data point was chosen because we presumed that increasing the amount of times the subject washes their belly button, the lower amounts of bacteria cultures present. The charts show each test subject's data by the user selecting their id from the drop-down menu.
